I want you to come up with some quotes in the following style i'm going to teach you. The quotes need to be made out of two parts. 
The first part is a part where i want people to make intrigued to know the second part. 

Here are two examples:


Example one:
First part:

If you really love someone...

Second part:

You have to let it go.

Example two:
First part:
When you're in lave...

Second part:
you just know, no matter what anyone else says

If you understand, say yes.
